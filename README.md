# Neo Security Bot

A Discord bot focused on advanced server protection and anti-raid automation. It monitors suspicious activities (like mass bans, kicks, channel/role changes) and takes automated action to protect your server from malicious users.

---

## Features

- **Anti-Raid & Security Automation:**  
  Detects and mitigates suspicious actions such as mass bans, kicks, channel deletions/creations, and role removals.
- **Automated Response:**  
  When a user exceeds configurable thresholds for destructive actions, the bot:
  - Removes all their roles (except @everyone)
  - Removes Administrator from @everyone if present
  - Alerts the server owner via DM
  - Logs incidents to a configurable log channel
- **Customizable Protection:**  
  Per-server settings for action thresholds and time intervals.
- **Slash Command Interface:**  
  All configuration and status via `/protection` command.
- **Persistent Logging:**  
  Keeps a rolling log of the last 20 security alerts per server.

---

## How It Works

- The bot listens for key moderation events (channel create/delete, member ban/kick, role removal).
- It tracks user actions in real-time using an in-memory tracker.
- If a user exceeds the allowed number of actions within a set time window, the bot triggers automated countermeasures and logs the incident.
- All actions and settings are stored per-server using a lightweight database (`pro.db`).
